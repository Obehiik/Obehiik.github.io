## Work Experience

### Research Assistant (Volunteer)  
**Snohomish County Health Department** (Oct 2024 – Mar 2025, Ongoing)  
- Developed highly annotated R scripts to create a standardized repository for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2011–2022).  
- Authored a statistical analysis plan (SAP) outlining methodologies for trend analysis, demographic stratification, and regression modeling.  
- Built reusable R scripts for trend analysis, demographic prevalence analysis, and logistic regression to identify predictors of tobacco, marijuana, and e-cigarette use.  
- Created interactive data visualizations (time-series plots, trend-line graphs, confidence intervals) to enhance clarity and statistical interpretation.  
- Prepared monthly progress reports and technical documentation for future analysts.

### Research Assistant (Volunteer)  
**Seattle Children’s Hospital — Pediatric Transport Learning Team** (Mar 2024 – Jun 2024)  
- Analyzed 6,000+ pediatric transport records, applying Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Generalized Mixed Models (GMM) for longitudinal data.  
- Identified patterns in vital signs and transport outcomes using R visualizations.  
- Provided insights and recommendations to improve pediatric transport protocols through comprehensive reports and interactive dashboards.

## Research Projects

### Clinical Trial Protocol Development  
**University of Washington** (Mar 2024 – Jun 2024)  
- Collaborated in a team of four to develop a multicenter, three-arm, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol aimed at reducing childhood asthma incidence.  
- Contributed to sample size calculations and the statistical analysis plan.  
- Ensured proper randomization procedures and adherence to protocol guidelines across clinical sites.  
- Produced detailed documentation for study protocol, sample size, and analysis plan.

### Survival Analysis Research  
**University of Texas at San Antonio** (Apr 2023)  
- Analyzed survival outcomes for 137 lung cancer veterans to identify prognostic factors.  
- Employed exponential and Cox proportional hazards models to analyze survival time.  
- Conducted model diagnostics using AIC, probability plots, and residual analysis.  
- Authored a comprehensive report documenting statistical methodology and findings.

### Clinical Risk Factor Analysis  
**University of Washington** (Jul 2024)  
- Investigated associations between comorbidities (CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension) and liver fibrosis progression in 215 NASH patients.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis with forest plots and ggplot2 visualizations.  
- Built multivariate logistic regression models with robust diagnostics and sensitivity analyses.  
- Created a Quarto document with detailed methodology and reproducible research findings.

### Longitudinal Health Research  
**University of Washington** (Sep 2024)  
- Explored cholesterol trajectories over 10 years among 2,634 Framingham Heart Study participants.  
- Found a 1.13 mg/dL greater biennial cholesterol increase in females compared to males.  
- Applied linear mixed effects models and GEE for advanced statistical analysis.  
- Documented the research process and findings in a reproducible Quarto report.
