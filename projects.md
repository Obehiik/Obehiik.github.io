## **Longitudinal Analysis of Sex Differences in Cholesterol Trajectories | R**

**Project Goal:**  
Investigate whether sex influences cholesterol changes over time by analyzing 10-year Framingham Heart Study data to inform sex-specific cardiovascular health strategies.

</div>

**Impact & Key Findings:**
- Uncovered significant gender differences from 2,634 participants.
- Found females exhibited a 1.13 mg/dL greater biennial increase compared to males (controlling for age, BMI, and smoking).
- Informed sex-specific risk assessment and prevention strategies.

**Methods & Tools:**
- Linear Mixed Effects Models and GEE.
- R programming with ggplot2 and lme4.
- Robust model validation and hypothesis testing.

</div>

**Project Goal:**  
Identify and quantify key risk factors for liver fibrosis progression in NASH patients to support clinical decision-making.

**Impact & Key Findings:**
- Analyzed clinical data from 215 NASH patients.
- Identified comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension.
- Quantified risk through odds ratios and confidence intervals.

**Methods & Tools:**
- Multivariate logistic regression with comprehensive diagnostics.
- R for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.
- Sensitivity analyses and clear forest plot visualizations.

## **Heart Failure Mortality Analysis | R**

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="images/image.png" alt="Kaplan Meier Survival Curve">
</div>

**Project Goal:**  
Evaluate the impact of key comorbidities (diabetes, anemia, high blood pressure) on mortality risk in heart failure patients.

**Impact & Key Findings:**
- Analyzed survival patterns in 299 heart failure patients.
- Identified high blood pressure as a significant risk factor (Adjusted HR = 1.53).
- Documented a 32% mortality rate, highlighting the importance of blood pressure management.

**Methods & Tools:**
- Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.
- Validation via proportional hazards testing.
- Advanced visualization using R's survival and survminer packages.
